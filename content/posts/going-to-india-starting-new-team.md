I've just booked a business trip to Bangalore, India. It will be my first time travelling there. I'm excited for these three reasons:

1. I will meet my new team.
2. I love Indian food.
3. My connection is through Frankfurt, Germany. It is very likely I *accidentally* miss my connection on my return and am forced to take a mini-vacation.

In 2018 I helped launch a custom built application at Dell which allows development teams to manage all PC platform development and validation activities in a single portal. This application took off, and is now being used by over 1500 of my colleagues and vendors. Due to the success it's had, I'm working on growing the team in India to help us manage and develop it further. This team will also help elevate our org to a whole new level of capabilities and innovation.

In this trip I will be meeting with very talented engineers whom I look forward to working with. Some of the team members are internal hires, while others are external hires. Four out of the eight initial team members are women engineers, and soon to be 5. I'm working with HR and management to ensure we have a diverse team, and that at least half of hires are women.

I think this will be the beginning of many future trips to the country. Expect a write up about what I learned and how the trip went on my return. 

Until next time.
