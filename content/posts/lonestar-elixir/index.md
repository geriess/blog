Last week I attended the Lonestar Elixir conference in Austin. I was lucky to have spent quality time with a very talented and welcoming group of people. I was also fortunate enough to meet José Valim, creator of the Elixir programming language.

I received training on [Nerves](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves) and NervesHub, which is a framework for embedded software and IoT applications. This was particularly exciting as it brought me back to my hardware roots. I used to spend a lot of time designing hardware for Dell. During the first hour of training we were discussing SPI, I2C, GPIO, UART, hexadecimal values, and data sheets, and I immediately knew I was in the right place. These things just make me happy.

Another exciting thing I learned was [Phoenix Framework](https://phoenixframework.org/), which enables server-rendered HTML pages, interactive, and real-time applications. I believe this technology has the potential to disrupt many things. Also, please take a look at [Phoenix LiveView](https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript) and see how amazing this feature is.

My interest for Elixir and the Erlang ecosystem has grown significantly. If only I can find a place to implement these at work. I guess this will be my quest in the coming weeks. I hope to make some progress in this space so that I can come back and tell you about how cool this technology is!

Until next time.
