I stumbled into Elixir in my quest to learn more about distributed computing frameworks and programming languages. I have been playing with the language more and more every week and can say I'm really excited about the potential. Having used Go (golang) a while back, I can say Elixir looks more interesting and fun to learn. Elixir has close ties to Erlang, which is the language Ericsson created in the 1980's to address telcom issues at the time.

In the next few weeks I will be finding ways to pilot test this language at work. Here is a brief overview of the language including a mini demo of distributed computing.
