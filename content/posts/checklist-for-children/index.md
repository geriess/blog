A while back I attended an Agile methodology training, and in this class I created a sample project working with a team to simulate the Agile principles. This sample project resulted in a mini-book aimed at children  and it is called **Filthy Fresh Squad Checklist for Children**. The aim of the book is to illustrate principles related to kid’s playtime, responsibility, hygiene, and morals. Does this mean I am now an author? Here’s the entire book (all four pages of it). As you can tell, I had a little fun with this. :)
