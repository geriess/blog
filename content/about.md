Hi,

Welcome to my blog, and thank you for being here. My name is **Geries Simon** and I'm currently working as a Software Architect at Dell in Austin, Texas.

## Some background

I'm an Electrical Engineering graduate of Texas A&M University. I started my career at Dell as a Hardware Engineer and then slowly transitioned into software. I was born in Honduras and moved to the U.S. many years ago. I'm a husband and a father.

## What I'm working on

My current mission is in a team called Client Engineering Digitalization, to transform workflows and streamline collaboration through digitalization. I enable solutions that help my colleagues and I have a better and more productive work environment. I travel around the world  to meet the most wonderful people and to make magical things happen. 

## What I like to do

Aside from my never-ending interests and activities in the technology space, I often ride my mountain bike across various Austin bike trails. I enjoy throwing a frisbee around on the weekends, kicking a soccer ball, doing picnics with my family and friends, and talking about geeky things. I also created a mens group called [Tacos with Joe](https://facebook.com/tacoswithjoe/) where I meet weekly with a group of guys to eat tacos and share in authentic and vulnerable conversations.

## My interests

My interests are in distributed computing, infrastructure, and automation. I'd like to play with things that relate to Go, the programming language. I also would like to do more writing in my free time, and this is the main reason I started this blog. I'll keep my fingers crossed that there will be more than one post on this blog. :)

## Get in touch
